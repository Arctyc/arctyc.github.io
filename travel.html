            <h4>You won't have to worry about travel on this trip</h4>
            <p>
                When you step off the plane or ship, you'll have an abundance of options for getting around the island. Those that want to take travel into their own hands (or feet) will find that Taniti is a very walk-friendly island. For those that prefer to travel by car, there are taxis and vehicle rentals available.
            </p>

                    <h4>Airport</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most visitors arrive in style via Taniti's cozy airport (PTNI). Scheduled flights arrive 3 times per day, but the airport is open 24/7 and private air traffic is common. The airport is nestled just outside Taniti City and is the perfect arrival point for those looking to get right into the thick of their visit.
